Work experience
======
* 11/2023-07/2024: Algorithm Intern
  * SLAM Lab, [Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd](https://www.huawei.com/cn/)
  * Duties includes:
    * For the application scenario of smart glasses, the synthesis of 3D photos is explored by combining open source algorithms and internal binocular depth estimation algorithms, and the performance of different algorithms is compared.
    * For the depth estimation task, heterogeneous knowledge distillation and semantic supervision are performed.
    * Explore the application of Mamba to 3D scenes.
  * Supervisor: [Gengyu Ma](https://cn.linkedin.com/in/%E8%B5%93%E5%AE%87-%E9%A9%AC-466a86108)

* Summer 2023: Intelligent data Analytics intern
  * [Wind Information Co., Ltd](https://www.wind.com.cn/portal/en/AboutUs/index.html)
  * Duties included:
    * For the business scenario of chart translation in financial reports, the relevant library functions are used to generate chart detection data sets.
    * On the basis of the generated data, the performance is evaluated by training with some open source models.

Project list
======
* 10/2021-05/2022, Text Detection and Recognition in Natural Scenes
  * Role: Algorithm Designer
  * Content:
    * Through the algorithm design, the task of text detection and recognition in natural scenes is realized.
  * Achievement:
    * My model finally achieved the third place in the MLT2019 end-to-end detection and recognition task.

* 03/2023-04/2023, 2023 RoadText Competition
  * Role: Team Leader
  * The RoadText challenge is a competition that aims to advance the current state of the art in scene text detection, recognition, andtracking in videos. This is a particularly challenging task due to the unique characteristics of text in driving videos.
