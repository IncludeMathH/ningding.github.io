Hi there! My name is Ning Ding（丁宁） and I'm a second year undergraduate student from [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Liangrui Peng](http://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/pengliangrui/zh_CN/index.htm). I come from Lushi County, Sanmenxia City, Henan Province. It has been a wonderful journey for me to enter the top universities in China's first-tier cities step by step from a small poor county.

In my free time I enjoy watching movies, reading books and running (the best time for the 10 km was 4 minutes 37 seconds per kilometer). I'm passionate about using technology to solve problems. My recent goal is to become a famous algorithm engineer, and my more lofty ideal is to make the world better and become a respected person! I'm always willing to learn, and I love connecting with others. Feel free to say hi if you see me around campus! Thanks for visiting my page.
