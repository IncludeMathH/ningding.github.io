I'm a third year undergraduate student from [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University. My research interest includes OCR, object tracking and 3D vision.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Liangrui Peng](http://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/pengliangrui/zh_CN/index.htm).
